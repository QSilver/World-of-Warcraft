Changed paths:
   M /trunk/Localizations/enUS.lua
   M /trunk/Presets/General.lua
   M /trunk/Raven_Options/Options.lua

Clean up prior to release. One bug fix in options for entering custom bars. A number of minor tweaks to options panel to fix truncated text elements.

Addition of new spell ids for warlock minions (currently there are no minion timers but this change will support adding that feature, if there is interest, now that minions are no longer represented as totems in the default UI).
