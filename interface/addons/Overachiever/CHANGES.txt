- Rewrote much of the cache module. This should fix some issues with faction-specific data and potentially problems with the cache not treating the index for kill criteria appropriately.
- Cache module: The tooltip indicating an achievement is required for a meta-achievement can now display an Alliance or Horde icon to show when the cache indicates the requirement is exclusive to one faction.

- Cache module:
-- This module now improves the accuracy of cross-faction data. For instance, the meta-achievement "Master of Warsong Gulch" requires a different version of "Quick Cap" for each faction. Without the cache module, only the "Quick Cap" for your own faction indicates that it is required by another achievement. With Overachiever_Cache enabled, both versions now indicate this.
-- For a complete cache, you will need to have logged into both an Alliance and a Horde character. (Most of the time, this is a non-issue. Most cached data is not faction specific. Even faction-specific achievements usually provide the same data to both factions.)
-- Fixed an issue where populating the cache while logged into a character of one faction prevented data from the other faction from being added.
- Fixed an issue where some of the opposing faction's achievements were sometimes automatically tracked in battlegrounds.
